# 7 Core Building Blocks of AI Agents  

## Lessons From Building AI Applications  

Through hands-on projects and many conversations with developers, it became clear that most AI frameworks rarely make it into production.  

The AI systems that succeed are usually built on custom components rather than off-the-shelf frameworks. Instead of handing full control to an LLM, these systems use traditional software for most parts, bringing in the LLM only when it adds real value.  

The main takeaway is straightforward: LLMs shouldn’t make every decision. They work best when handling reasoning with context, while the rest of the workflow is driven by structured, deterministic code.  

The practical approach looks like this:  

- Break problems into smaller, well-defined parts  
- Apply solid software engineering practices to each part  
- Use an LLM only when deterministic solutions aren’t enough  

LLM calls are powerful but expensive and sometimes unreliable. To get consistent results, context must be prepared carefully before sending it to the model. In practice, most “AI agents” are just workflows with a series of steps where only a few require AI.

## The 7 Building Blocks  

Here are the seven building blocks that consistently show up in effective AI agents. By combining these, complex problems can be broken down and solved step by step.  

### 1. Intelligence  
The core AI capability: sending input to an LLM and receiving output. This step makes the system more than ordinary software.  

### 2. Memory  
Since LLMs don’t remember past interactions, context has to be stored and re-supplied so the system can carry conversations or tasks over time.  

### 3. Tools  
Real-world agents must interact with external systems - calling APIs, updating databases, or reading files. Tools give the LLM the ability to trigger these actions.  

### 4. Validation  
LLM outputs are not always reliable. Validating responses against schemas ensures downstream systems don’t fail.  

### 5. Control  
Deterministic rules, condition checks, and routing logic are still necessary. Not everything should be left to the AI.  

### 6. Recovery  
Errors are inevitable. Retry mechanisms, fallbacks, and graceful error handling are critical for production systems.  

### 7. Feedback  
Human oversight can be built in when needed. Having review or approval steps ensures that important decisions are not left entirely to automation.

## Closing Note  

These seven blocks form a reliable foundation for building AI agents. While the intelligence of LLMs is impressive, much of the strength of these systems comes from how they are combined with careful engineering practices.
